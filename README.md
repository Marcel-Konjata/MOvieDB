project live at https://marcel-konjata.github.io/MOvieDB

this is my attempt to work with database API and "learn from mistakes" React site.

Overall I did a lot of mistakes and took away a lot of knowledge for ongoing projects.

Lessons Learned
1. always do prop-types immidiatelly
2. learned about updating state after react-router props change
3. learned how to deal with PORTAL
4. figured out that NAMING is hard and styled components can turn into bloody mess, not overuse nesting
5. create right away
6. never ever say: nah why to bother with comments
7. React spring is super powerfull but it's docs are super shit 
(sorry to say that but only understand to docs took me 4 days, and I still dont have a clue how to use it as keyframes or for fancy stuff, examples helped a lot but docs are sh..
8. next time use hooks
